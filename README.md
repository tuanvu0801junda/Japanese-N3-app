#Japanese-learning-app with multiple choices.

How to run: After cloning, move to Download

1. ~/Download/Japanese-muiltiple-choice$ make clean
2. ~/Download/Japanese-muiltiple-choice$ make 
3. ~/Download/Japanese-muiltiple-choice$ ./run

I'm trying to write a cmake instead of this old-styled makefile.
